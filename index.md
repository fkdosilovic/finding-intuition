Hi, my name is Filip Karlo Došilović and I'm currently a student, pursuing Master's
degree in Computer Science at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing,
University of Zagreb, Croatia.

Most blog posts here answer, or at least try to answer, some question(s) on
machine learning, describe the process of implementing papers, etc. , with the
ultimate goal of deeper understanding of the subject.

I hope you will enjoy reading these pages as much as I enjoy writing them.
