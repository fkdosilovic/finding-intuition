# FAQ

**Do you update your older posts?** &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, I do. Since English is
not my first language, I'll update my posts whenever I see or get notified of a
badly written sentence. Sometimes I'll misspell a word or have bad grammar, and,
on other occasions, I might find a better explanation for some part of the post.
